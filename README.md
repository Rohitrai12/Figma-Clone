# Figma Clone

Welcome to the Figma Clone project! This application aims to replicate the functionality of Figma, a popular design tool, with real-world features like live collaboration through cursor chat, comments, reactions, and drawing designs (shapes, image upload) on the canvas. Built using Next.js 14, Fabric.js, and Liveblocks, this project provides a collaborative design environment with interactive features.
